3. Then execute the following commands in terminal in order to build from source:

    ```cd Downloads/TicTacToe```

    ```gcc ttt_serv.c -o ttt_serv```

    ```gcc ttt_client.c -o ttt_client```

4. In order to run server in the first terminal type:

    ```./ttt_serv```

5. And to run client in the other one type:

    ```./ttt_client```
