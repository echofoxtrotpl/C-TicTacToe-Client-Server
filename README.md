# C TicTacToe TCP socket programming
**Creation date: 2021-01-05**

This is a C, console based implementation of TicTacToe game, with TCP socket connection between client and server for C programming classes in the first semester.

To start you will need a C compiler, and two terminal windows (or two tabs) opened.

1. Download ZIP with source code from this repo.
2. Extract it somewhere e.g. "Downloads/TicTacToe".
3. Then execute the following commands in terminal in order to build from source:

    ```cd Downloads/TicTacToe```

    ```gcc ttt_serv.c -o ttt_serv```

    ```gcc ttt_client.c -o ttt_client```

4. In order to run a server in the first terminal type:

    ```./ttt_serv```

5. And to run a client in the other terminal type:

    ```./ttt_client```

6. Now you can play!
