# Console based Tic Tac Toe game, written in C with TCP socket programming and Minimax Algorithm
**Creation date: 2021-01-05**

This is a C, console based implementation of TicTacToe game, with **TCP socket** connection between client and server for my C programming classes in the first semester.

This version is using **Minimax Algorithm** in order to provide opponent 'AI'.

To start you will need to run server first and then clients.
